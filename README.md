## üéØ What I'm Working On
### üèéÔ∏è MotorHead 
‚ÑπÔ∏è A web/mobile platform where automotive enthusiasts can thrive, collaborate, and share their custom builds. 
- This platform will provide social media features such as user-following, "build" feeds, event planning, and story-telling behind each project.
- Each `"build"` created features a photo/video gallery, showcasing unique personality and attention to detail within the work poured into each build.
- A build page can contain: A story section (highlights the journey and/or inspiration behind the project), a vehicle details section, a modifications section (table of cosmetic or performance parts, with included links, prices, and descriptions/notes), a Collaborators section (Ability to give credit to performance / specialty shops who helped carry out work on the build, ex. Custom vinyl wrapping, body kits, engine tuning, etc.)
- Event Planning: Currently, Facebook has been the primary source of finding and creating car-meet events. MotorHead will aim to become the primary hub for enthusiasts wishing to search for and schedule local meets, where auto-enthusiasts can come together to show off their rides, and connect over a shared passion of performance/customized vehicles. 
- More to come!
